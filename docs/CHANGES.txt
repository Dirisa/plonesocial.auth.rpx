Fixed overwriting theme settings when installed.

Fixed JS error.

When RPX is not configured a message is shown instead of showing the link and iframe resulting in a 404 error.

Added provider icons.

It is now possible to select providers in the configlet that will be shown as icons in the portlet. When clicking on 
an icon the rpx overlay opens with the according provider preselected.
